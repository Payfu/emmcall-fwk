# Note

**This my personal MVC project**

*It's less heavy than Symfony, it's not perfect, but it works well.*

## Composer

```
composer require emmcall/mvc-fwk-2
```

## Unix
Move directories into the root.
```
mv -u vendor/emmcall/mvc-fwk-2/* ./
```

Move .gitignore and .htaccess files.
```
mv -u vendor/emmcall/mvc-fwk-2/.* ./
```

Remove emmcall directory.
```
rm -rf vendor/emmcall
```

*Time is lacking to explain how it works, sorry !*
